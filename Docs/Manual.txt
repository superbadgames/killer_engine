Need to look into this warning for the Vector3: 

c:\projects\killer1_engine\headers\vector3.h(27): warning C4172: returning address of local variable or temporary

I was able to fix this error very easily. Basicaly, when you are returning from a +, you don't want to bass by ref, because it can create memory issues. Because it is a rather small object, it is ok to pass it by value instead. If I ever redesign to make += to not just alter the current one, then it would return a ref.

The original post build events to copy the lib into the included project. This should be handled by the projects that need the lib, so that it can be more dynamic. Keeping these as a record. 

xcopy "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).lib" "C:\Projects\Killer1_UnitTests\ExLib\" /s /i /y
xcopy "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).lib" "C:\Projects\OpenGL_Tests\ExLib\" /s /i /y
xcopy "$(ProjectDir)..\..\..\Headers\*.h" "C:\Projects\OpenGL_Tests\Exlib\Headers" /s /i /y

The Entry Vec
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 2 models that come to mind as I begin the design of the engine itself. 

Model 1:
In this model, the engine is a .lib file, which has no entry Vec. The engine will act as a series of functions to compliement another project. This means that in order to make a game, there will need to be a c++ project that will have to call the library, and this will then call any external scripts ect. to run. 

Model 2: 
In this model, the entry Vec will be in the engine, and the engine will act not just as a library, but as a framework for building games. The scripting language will then interact with the engine, and the engine will be less controlled, and more something that you use. 

I am not sure which is the best design for where the project is heading. For now, I will go with model one. I am going to do this for a few reasons. First, because I know how. Second, because it is much easier.

Atoms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atom.h:
This is the header where base times, and common include files are to be placed.
Types:
Signed
U8  = __int8
U16 = __int16
U32 = __int32
U64 = __int64

Unsigned
S8  = unsigned __int8
S16 = unsigned __int16
S32 = unsigned __int32
S64 = unsigned __int64

Vecs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vec construct it meant to represent positions in the Cartesian Coordinate plane that is the rendering view field. As such, the operators needed for the Vec are more limited. Here are the operators that will be used: 

= : This is used to assigne one Vec to another. It is written to support both a Vec and a Vec*

+ : Used to Add one Vec to another. It would looke like this. VecC = VecA + VecB;

+= : Used to Add one Vec to another, in a short hand version. VecA += VecB;

The multiplication and division operators were not added because I do not see where they would ever be used. If in the future, when working on more aspects of the game, I could find that this would be useful, and if I do, I will add these operators.
